# üìù Dialogos

A super simple dialogue system for Python.

It's nothing special, but that's the point! It's something that just works.
This library is ideal for games that are made for a game jam.
For more complex games I would recommend extending Dialogos or using something else.

A Menu example

def gigi(content: str) -> Line: return text("Gigi", content)

d = Dialogue([

    end(),
    label("Sleep"),
    gigi("I drink the sleep."),
])

while not d.has_end():
    while d.has_menu():
        print()
        for i, choice in enumerate(d.choices()):
            print("({}) => {}".format(i, choice))
        print("(Default choice is (0).)\n")
        d.choose(0)
    line = d.line()
    print("{}: {}".format(line.info, line.content))
    d.next()
```
